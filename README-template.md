### What I learned

- i impreoved my knowledge of form as i tried different features before this project.
  i planned innitially using React but,had promised my self to always a plain front-end language before applying frameworks.it was worth the try though,would have been easier working with frameworks.

- I wont be explicit with different code approaches as i have made both the repository and live url
  available above.
